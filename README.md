The “[Asana Better Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vojtaflorian/Asana-Better-Workflow/main/AsanaBetterWorkflow.js)” userscript optimizes the user experience in Asana by modifying the interface and adding useful features. It adjusts the widths of task panes for better visibility and hides unnecessary UI elements like upgrade buttons and invitation icons. Additionally, the script automatically calculates and displays the number of days remaining until a task’s due date. A toggle button is provided to easily show or hide completed subtasks, and the script ensures that these settings persist across sessions by utilizing local storage. The script also automatically clicks to load more subtasks and expand truncated comments, streamlining the workflow and reducing manual effort.
